## Points of Interest

### [Mental Bot](./Mental%20Bot.md)

This includes features from [Mention Bot](./Mention%20Bot.md) and [Clear Bot](./Clear%20Bot), so of the three it is only necessary to see this one.

### [Polybot](./Polybot.md)

This is an older project, so it is nice to see how the coding style has changed.
